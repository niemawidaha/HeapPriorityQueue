# Heap Priority Queue Implementation 

Implementing a heap

In the assignment description on Blackboard, there is a link to code with classes for a max heap and a priority
queue based on a heap. Everything for the priority queue is written. Your job is to fill in the details for the heap
code.

(a) Write a method that inserts a new item into the heap.
(b) Write a method that deletes the highest value in the heap.
(c) Test your code and explain your choices of tests. 
    Were the results what you expected?
    
    Tests can be found in the main method. :-)
